## 👩‍💻 About the project

Task management application built in ReactJS. With this application, users can register, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

Key features:
- Task registration: Users can enter new tasks into the list through an input form.
- Task deletion: Users have the option to remove existing tasks from the list.
- Completion marking: Users can mark tasks as completed, indicating their progress.
The todo-list is a great tool for managing your daily tasks, ensuring that nothing is forgotten, and allowing you to stay in control of your progress.
